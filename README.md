### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I am Daniel de Oliveira

I am currently working on a desktop/server suite of tools for archaeological field recording,
where we use `Elixir` and `TypeScript`, `React`, `Angular` and `Electron`, `elasticsearch`, `couchdb/pouchdb`, `leaflet` and other technologies. See

https://github.com/dainst/idai-field

for which I wrote this functional combinator library

https://github.com/dainst/tsfun

I love functional programming and my preferred choice is `Clojure/ClojureScript`. See for example

There is also and experimental addition for `tsfun`, which explores a monadic program flow.
