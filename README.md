### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I am Daniel de Oliveira

I am currently working on a desktop/server suite of tools for archaeological field recording,
where we use `Elixir` and `TypeScript`, `React`, `Angular` and `Electron`.

I like functional programming and for my hobby projects I usually choose `Clojure/ClojureScript`, though lately I am also beginning to keep an eye on the developments around `ReasonML/ReScript`.

Trained in the field of `digital humanities` and a background in linguistics and philosophy one of my professsional fields of interest revolves around the modelling of complex domains (which archaeology is an excellent example of). Those domains are often required to reflect multiple viewpoints and also can evolve over time, both of which are non-trivial problems in the space of computer systems. 

While adressing these problems has to be solved in the field, on practical terms, over the years the observed problems continued to inspire me to investigate the cognitive foundations of modelling, towards thinking about the concept and origins of `concepts`, which in turn leads naturally to questions of General Artificial Intelligence, seen from this narrower perspective as general knowledge systems (making me see this connection clearly, I attribute to David Deutsch). I tend to think of cognition as a "compression algorithm" for boiling down reality into a "usable" form. My line of thinking here goes basically from Kant's epistemology over Susan Carey's Origin of Concept to Donald Hoffmann's take on reality. As for a "mechanism", I think concepts are representational theories of bits of the real world, mostly related with each other through analogical thinking (see Douglas Hofstadter). To understand this, I think, it would make sense to investigate the origins of our conceptual apparatus, basically back to the beginnings of life (for reasoning by continuity). All that said, I think of concepts as sort of "unstable", evolving entities (in the spirit of Dawkin's memes), which is in my opinion the basis of the difficulties encountered when trying to "model" reality in software engineering (or even scientific) settings.
